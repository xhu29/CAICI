        <h2>Welcome</h2>
        <p>
          Welcome to the <strong>CAICI Research Group</strong> led by <strong>Dr. Xi Hu</strong> in the Department of Technology at Illinois State University!
        </p>

        <h2>Mission</h2>
        <p>
          Our core mission is to advance and enrich the managerial practices of built assets (e.g., buildings, bridges, and pavements),
          construction workforce, and civil infrastructures through domain knowledge-enhanced, data-driven, technology-enabled,
          and AI-powered solutions. Our team focuses on developing automated and intelligent systems empowered by emerging technologies like artificial intelligence, robotics,
          and digital twins to address critical issues in construction and infrastructure management sector,
          such as aging and deteriorating infrastructures, and construction labor shortage.
