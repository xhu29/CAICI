            Prior to this appointment, he was at New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT) where he worked as both Graduate Research and Teaching Assistant
            and obtained his Ph.D. degree in Civil Engineering (Construction Management focus) in May 2025.
            His primary research interests are construction automation, robotics, data sensing and analytics, underpinned by interdisciplinary skills in Civil Engineering, Computer Engineering, etc.
            To date, his research has resulted in 25 articles published or accepted by renowned journals (e.g., Expert Systems with Applications, and Journal of Building Engineering)
            and conference proceedings (e.g., ASCE Computing in Civil Engineering, and ASCE Construction Research Congress).
            He also actively contributes to the academic community by serving as a reviewer for more than 20 journals
            (e.g., ASCE Journal of Management in Engineering, ASCE Journal of Construction Engineering and Management, Building and Environment, and Journal of Building Engineering)
            and 6 conferences (e.g., TRB Annual Meeting, and ASCE Computing in Civil Engineering).
            He has mentored greater than 10 student researchers with diverse cultural and educational backgrounds, from high school to graduate school level.
            For example, some high school students he mentored have been enrolled in several well-known higher education institutions like Carnegie Mellon University,
            University of Texas at Austin, and Boston College. Meanwhile, he has won multiple competitive awards, such as the 2025 Doctoral Excellence Award and the 3-Minute-Thesis Competition Honorable Mention at NJIT.</p>
